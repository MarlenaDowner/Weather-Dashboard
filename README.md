# Weather Dashboard

My motivation was to build a 5 Day Weather Forecast app to retrieve weather data for cities apon users request.I built this project to give the user easy in accessing different weather condition when on the go. This app is perfect for someone who travels alot or even a commuter on their day to day tasks.
 
## Apps functionality:

* The weather dashboard contains the following. 
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
